  abstract = {Winfree (1996) proposed a Turing-universal model of DNA self-assembly. In this abstract model, DNA double-crossover molecules self-assemble to form an algorithmically-patterned two-dimensional lattice. Here, we develop a more realistic model based on the thermodynamics and kinetics of oligonucleotide hydridization. Using a computer simulation, we investigate what physical factors in uence the error rates, i.e., when the more realistic model deviates from the ideal of the abstract model. We nd, in agreement with rules of thumb for crystal growth, that the lowest error rates occur at the melting temperature when crystal growth is slowest, and that error rates can be made arbitrarily low by decreasing concentration and increasing binding strengths.},
